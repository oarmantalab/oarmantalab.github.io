<div class="justify">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, with graduate degrees in Transportation Engineering and Statistics. My research focuses on understanding human mobility, adoption of emerging transportation technologies, equity, and safety in transportation systems. I use a combination of behavioral modeling, spatial econometrics, machine learning, and data analytics to study how new technologies affect travel behavior and transportation systems. The goal of my work is to develop frameworks and policy-relevant insights that guide the efficient, equitable, and sustainable integration of emerging technologies into transportation systems.
